  To start learning graphics programming, I decided to start with C.
</p>

want a C programming environment that is lean if possible...



# TCC

searched...

found TCC!

"tcc" ~ looks good :) ~ I'll start there!

I can download, but no repo? where is repo? what is this?
.
found it!
.
Savannah ~ a "software forge" for free software ~ that's pretty cool!
It looks like a Github with significantly more charm.
I don't actually know...
.
wound up here ~ https://www.dreamsongs.com/MobSoftware.html
.
I guess "mob software" is the idea ~ that infinite people should work on projects ~ I think...

Anyway... Let's go...

I wrote a "Hello, World!" program.

Cool! It worked!



Next, is some graphics!

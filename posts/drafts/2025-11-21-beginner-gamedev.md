# The story of a beginner video game developer (before game engines)

<!--
Do I even post this?
-->

*Below is a story about me when I was a young chap (combined with wisdom of being a bit older) wanting to build a 3D video game before game engines existed. I also think this story is quite likely the same story as many, many other people. The story is told in the 'you' tense - like, a copy of myself talking to myself. I hope you enjoy.* 🙂

So, you want to build a video game.

Why?

Is that even a question?

Because video games are remarkable, beautiful things.

Duh.

Moving on!

## What should I do?

So, on to the next step, what should you do?

Well, in theory, you have to first understand what you are ACTUALLY saying.

You want to develop an **interactive computer application** with **real-time computer-generated graphics and sounds** portraying a **virtual world** where **inputs** from a user **change the state** of the world.

That's a lot... And, there is no denying that. I don't care what universe you are from. That is a lot.

- Programming - have to learn about computers and how to program computers
- Graphics - have to learn about graphics and how to create and program graphics
- Sound - have to learn about audio and how to create and program audio

So, you can technically still play a video game with the sound off (so audio isn't vital) (although it is still a HUGE part of video games) (ie, I think very few people would buy a video game that didn't have any sound) and programming is something you learn simply by doing it, so the best course of action is to start with **graphics**.

## Graphics, baby! Let's go!

So, beginners tend to jump straight into **graphics programming** thinking, "I'm going to put stuff on the screen and it's going to be amazing!" completely disregarding the "learn about graphics" part...

But, here's the thing... You're a go-getter. You're an "action-oriented" kind of person (although, you don't know that about yourself yet), so you say, well, I'll learn as I "dig through the trenches" - let's just **GO**, let's just **DO IT**.

You start "Googling" things, find a tutorial that you seem to resonate with, install a C compiler, make a hello world, and things feel okay ✅. Then, all of a sudden, things get complicated really, really quick (seemingly out of nowhere) - there are words you don't know, you're completely lost, you try to ignore those words and keep moving on, that makes it worse, then you finally just give up after a week of nothingness.

So, I can say from (this exact) experience, bringing a shovel is probably much, much better than jumping into trenches and digging with your bare hands...

But, the question is, what is the equivalent of a shovel in the context of video game development?

# Quick update!

Hi! I just wanted to write something because, well, it's been a while! (sorry for ghosting - no pun intended, either, lol)

I've been a bit occupied lately (hence the ghosting)... But, I have managed to do a few things!

I've,

- Decided to use a SSG (static site generator) and write markdown rather than raw HTML for writing blog posts (the SSG converts markdown into HTML ✅)
- Learned 11ty - the SSG 🙂
- Ported my raw HTML blog to 11ty
- Configured GitHub Pages to host 11ty via "GitHub Actions" (which are very cool)
- Researched and discovered StackEdit for creating/editing markdown files (ie, blog posts) in my GitHub repo 🙂 (in fact, I'm writing this post in StackEdit right now 👀)

Lots of goodies discovered! Lots of adventures! 🧙‍♂️

I plan to do posts about all of these things, but for now I just wanted to do this small update!

I hope you are well, and I look forward to seeing you again soon! 👻🙂🙏

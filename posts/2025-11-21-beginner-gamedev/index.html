<h1>The story of a beginner video game developer (before game engines)</h1>
<p><em>Below is a story about me when I was a younger chap (combined with some wisdom of being a bit older today) wanting to build a 3D video game before game engines were well-known. I also think this story is quite likely the same story as many, many other people. The story is told in the 'you' tense - like, a copy of myself talking to myself. I hope you enjoy.</em> 🙂</p>
<p>So, you want to build a video game.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Is that even a question?</p>
<p>Because video games are remarkable, beautiful things.</p>
<p>Duh.</p>
<p>Moving on!</p>
<h2>What should you do?</h2>
<p>So, on to the next step, what should you do?</p>
<p>Well, in theory, you have to first understand what you are ACTUALLY saying.</p>
<p>You want to develop a <strong>computer application</strong> with <strong>real-time computer-generated graphics and sounds</strong> portraying a <strong>virtual world</strong> where <strong>inputs</strong> from a user <strong>change the state</strong> of the world.</p>
<p>That's a lot... And, there is no denying that. I don't care what universe you are from. That is a lot.</p>
<ul>
<li>Programming - you have to learn about computers and how to program computers</li>
<li>Graphics - you have to learn about graphics and how to create and program graphics</li>
<li>Sound - you have to learn about audio and how to create and program audio</li>
</ul>
<p>So, you can technically still play a video game with the sound off (so audio isn't vital) (although it is still a HUGE part of video games) (ie, I think very few people would buy a video game that didn't have any sound) and programming is something you learn simply by doing it, so the best course of action is to start with <strong>graphics</strong>.</p>
<h2>Graphics, baby! Let's go!</h2>
<p>So, beginners tend to jump straight into <strong>graphics programming</strong> thinking, &quot;I'm going to put stuff on the screen and it's going to be amazing!&quot; completely disregarding the &quot;learn about graphics&quot; part...</p>
<p>But, here's the thing... You're a &quot;go-getter&quot; - an &quot;action-oriented&quot; kind of person (although, you don't consciously know that about yourself yet), so you say, well, I'll learn as I &quot;dig through the trenches&quot; - let's just <strong>GO</strong>, let's just <strong>DO IT</strong>.</p>
<p>You start &quot;Googling&quot; (using Google to search for) things, find a tutorial that resonates with you, install a C compiler, make a hello world program, and things feel okay ✅. Then, all of a sudden, things get complicated really quick (seemingly out of nowhere) - there are words you don't know, you're completely lost, you try to ignore those words and just keep moving on, that makes it worse, then you finally just give up after a week of essentially nothingness.</p>
<h2>Lesson: perhaps bring a shovel to the trenches</h2>
<p>So, I can say from (this exact) experience, bringing a shovel is naturally much, much better than jumping into trenches and digging with your bare hands...</p>
<p>So, the big question is, what is the equivalent of a shovel in the context of video game development?</p>
<p>I'd say the modern-day answer is a &quot;game engine&quot; (Godot, Unity, Unreal, etc). But, back then, game engines didn't really exist (in the mainstream, anyway) (NOTE: I used to build games in Flash+ActionScript, but that was for 2D games and I wanted to do 3D). And, today, I wish to build &quot;from scratch&quot;, so even today, I don't want to use a mainstream game engine.</p>
<p>So, then, what is the shovel equivalent?</p>
<p>I'd say it's really just &quot;knowledge&quot;.</p>
<p>I think you just have to know what you're doing... And, I think that's really it...</p>
<p>Oh, and, the reality is, video game development is simply not for beginners. There are simply too many different things to learn that you can't learn all at once.</p>
<p>So, what do you do?</p>
<p>You first become a beginner of &quot;computer graphics&quot;. Then, later on, you become a &quot;graphics programming beginner&quot;, then you become a &quot;software engineering beginner&quot;, then you become an &quot;audio programmer beginning&quot;, then you become a &quot;FILL IN THE BLANK beginner&quot;, etc, etc.</p>
<p>I think the whole process is a deep and uneventful road. But, I think that's just the way it goes. I think modern-day game engines help you get immediate positive feedback - ie, in about 5 hours, you can have a beautiful rotating cube on the screen - 1 hour to download and install a massively bloated game engine on your computer, 3 hours to learn the absolute basics of navigating the editor that the game engine comes with, and 1 hour for your 2 lines of code to finally work because it keeps breaking because you don't know how to code yet. And, hey, 5 hours is amazing compared to, say, 5 months. And, I think that immediate satisfaction gives you endorphins to want to keep going, whereas having a red square on a screen after 1 month is a bit grim and makes it easy to just want to give up.</p>
<h2>How to not give up?</h2>
<p>So, how does one not give up when things are seemingly uneventful and things don't feel like you're making progress towards your actual goal of making a video game?</p>
<p>I think there are a few things one can do</p>
<ul>
<li>Every time you work on anything related to video game development, remind yourself of the end goal of making your dream video game so that you don't lose sight and lose inspiration.</li>
<li>Find beauty in every little part of every subject you learn along the way and appreciate even the smallest things. Computers are quite remarkable, complex machines. It's impressive that you can do anything with them at all.</li>
</ul>
<p>I suppose I'm currently trying these things, and I'll see how it goes!</p>
<p>Admittedly, however, due to &quot;life things&quot;, gamedev things are currently a bit slow for me... But, hey! It's still going! And, that's what matters! 🙂</p>
<p>I hope you enjoyed this story and I look forward to chatting again soon! 🙂</p>

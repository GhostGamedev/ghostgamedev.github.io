<h1>Quick update!</h1>
<p>Hi! I just wanted to write something because, well, it's been a while! (sorry for ghosting - no pun intended)</p>
<p>I've been a bit occupied lately (hence the ghosting)... But, I have managed to do a few things!</p>
<p>I've,</p>
<ul>
<li>Decided to use a SSG (static site generator) and write markdown rather than raw HTML for blog posts (the SSG converts markdown into HTML ✅)</li>
<li>Learned 11ty - the SSG 🙂</li>
<li>Ported my raw HTML blog to 11ty</li>
<li>Configured GitHub Pages to host 11ty via using &quot;GitHub Actions&quot;</li>
<li>Researched and discovered StackEdit for creating/editing markdown files (ie, blog posts) in my GitHub repo 🙂 (in fact, I'm writing this post in StackEdit right now 👀)</li>
</ul>
<p>Lots of goodies discovered! Lots of adventures! 🧙‍♂️</p>
<p>I plan to do posts about all of these things, but for now I just wanted to do this small update!</p>
<p>I hope you are well, and I look forward to seeing you again soon! 👻🙂🙏</p>
